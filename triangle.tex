\item In the interactive window below, points $A$, $B$ and $C$ can be moved by using the mouse. Simply click-and-drag a point to a new location. You can also move a point by moving the slider bars using the same click-and-drag technique. $xA$ controls the $x$-coordinate of $A$, and $yA$ controls the $y$-coordinate of $A$. You may also move the slider bars in increments of 0.01 by slowly clicking on the slider bar. For example, clicking on the $yC$ control bar to the right of the circle indicator will increase the $y$-coordinate of point $C$, moving point $C$ up slightly. You are limited to $x$ and $y$-coordinates between -5 and 5. 

{\bf {Instructions:}} Slide points $A$, $B$ and $C$ until the three sides of the triangle have lengths 5, 7 and 8. Work in groups of 3. Be as different from your group members as possible. Try to produce triangles that look different from your other group members' triangles.

\begin{question}
How many different triangles did your group produce?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{It is impossible to produce a triangle with sides of length 5, 7, and 8}
\choice[correct]{There is one unique triangle with sides of length 5, 7, and 8}
\choice{There are two distinct triangles with sides of length 5, 7, and 8}
\choice{There are many triangles with sides of length 5, 7, and 8}
\end{multipleChoice}
\begin{question}
(Note: Round answers to the nearest $0.1^\circ$)

What is the size of the degree measure of the largest angle? $\answer[tolerance=0.1]{59.9}^\circ$

What is the size of the degree measure of the smallest angle? $\answer[tolerance=0.1]{59.9}^\circ$

What is the size of the degree measure of the largest angle? $\answer[tolerance=0.1]{59.9}^\circ$
